    "Kisses in the alley, where the sun don't shine|her shadow fades just like mine.",
    "She wore regret like a second skin|but never let the sorrow in.",
    "A Polaroid smile fades with time|just like your hand slipping out of mine.",
    "I heard your laugh in an old tape hiss|like a memory I can't dismiss.",
    "You left your name in the condensation|a fleeting ghost of conversation.",
    "Echoes of goodbye haunt the payphone line|but Iâ€™m still waiting for a sign.",
    "The party ended, but you're still dancing|lost in a song that's always chancing.",
    "Love letters torn, scattered in the breeze|like secrets whispered to the trees."
